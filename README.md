## Requirements

```r
install.packages(c("flexdashboard", "dplyr", "readr", "plotly", "scales", "ggalt"), dependencies = TRUE)
```

## Running the dashboard locally

```r
rmarkdown::run("dashboard.Rmd")
```

## Methods and data

Methods used are available in the R folder. [`R/cr_fetching.R`](R/cr_fetching.R) describes how licensing and journal metadata were obtained from [Crossref](https://www.crossref.org/), using the [rcrossref](https://github.com/ropensci/rcrossref) client, developed and maintained by the rOpenSci initiative (https://ropensci.org/). [`R/cr_match.R`](R/cr_match.R) shows how the dataset were merged together and how the count data used for the dashboard were calculated. 

<!--For a long-form documentation, see [about.md](about.md)-->

Comprehenive metadata about hybrid open access articles found are shared as well. See this [overview](data/README.md) about how datasets are coded to facilitate analysis.
