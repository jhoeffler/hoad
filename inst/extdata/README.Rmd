## Re-used data sources

Open data from the Open APC Initiative and Crossref were used to identify hybrid open access journals, as well as to obtain information about the publication activities of these journals.

### Open APC Initiative

#### [`oapc_hybrid.csv`](oapc_hybrid.csv)

This dataset was obtained from the [Open APC Initiative](https://github.com/openapc/openapc-de) and was used to determine hybrid open access journals. It also includes data about transformative aggrements, which has no pricing information, as well as country information.

Data schema: <https://github.com/OpenAPC/openapc-de/wiki/schema>

Tibble view in R:

```{r}
library(readr)
readr::read_csv("oapc_hybrid.csv")
```

### Crossref

#### [`jn_facets_df.json`](jn_facets_df.json)

JSON-ND file. Includes the following metadata from Crossref:

|Variable                     |Description                                                        |
|:----------------------------|:------------------------------------------------------------------|
|`issn`                       |ISSNs obtained from Open APC dataset used to query Crossref API    |
|`year_published`             |Lists yearly journal volume obtained from Crossref API facets      |
|`license_refs`               |Obtained Licence URIs                                              |
|`journal_title`              |Most frequent journal title                                        |
|`publisher`                  |Most frequent publisher name                                       |

How to load into R?

```{r eval=FALSE}
library(jsonlite)
jsonlite::stream_in(file("jn_facets_df.json"), simplifyDataFrame = FALSE)
```

#### [`hybrid_license_dois.json`](hybrid_license_dois.json)

JSON-ND file documenting articles found for every journal and open license URI.

Variable                    |Description
|:--------------------------|:--------------------------------------------------------------|
|`dois`                     |List fo DOIs                                                   |
|`issn`                     |ISSN obtained from Open APC dataset used to query Crossref API |
|`license`                  |Open License URI (non-normalised)                              |

```{r eval=FALSE}
library(jsonlite)
jsonlite::stream_in(file("hybrid_license_dois.json"), simplifyDataFrame = FALSE)
```

#### `hybrid_license_md.json`

`data/hybrid_license_md.json`contains full metadata of all open access articles found as it was parsed by the `rcrossref::cr_works()` function. Unfortunately, this data file is simply too large to be shared via GitHub. Please contact me, if you want access to it.

Tibble view in R:

```{r}
library(jsonlite)
library(dplyr)
jsonlite::stream_in(file("../data/hybrid_license_md.json"), verbose = FALSE) %>%
  dplyr::as_data_frame()
```

## Count data

#### [`indicator.csv`](indicator.csv)

[`indicator.csv`](indicator.csv) contains count data about the examined yearly journal volume. 

Coding scheme:

|Variable                    |Description
|:--------------------------|:------------------------------------------------------------------|
|`journal_title`            |Most frequent journal title used by Crossref                       |
|`publisher`                |Most frequent publisher name used by Crossref                      |

|`license_ref_n`            |Yearly article volume under the license `license`                  |
|`yearly_publisher_volume`  |Yearly article volume of all journals in the dataset per publisher |

```{r}
library(readr)
readr::read_csv("indicator.csv")
```

## Flipped journals

To detect fully open acces journals, the [Directory of Open Access Journals](https://doaj.org/) was checked. [`flipped_jns_doaj.csv`](flipped_jns_doaj.csv) contains the so detected articles published in fully open access journals.

```{r}
library(readr)
readr::read_csv("flipped_jns_doaj.csv")
```

Furthermore, [`flipped_jns.csv`](flipped_jns.csv) contains journals that are probably flipped, indicated by a proportion of open access article volume larger than 0.95 in at least two years.

```{r}
library(readr)
readr::read_csv("flipped_jns.csv")
```
